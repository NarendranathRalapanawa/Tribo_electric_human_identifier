Introduction
What is TENG?	
TENG ( Tribo-Electric Nano Generator ) is a device that uses triboelectricity to produce electrical energy and is known as a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). 


How does it work?
The triboelectric effect is a fundamental phenomenon in material science and the basis for Triboelectric Nanogenerators (TENGs). When two materials with different electron affinities come into contact and then separate, they generate an electric charge. Electron affinities indicate how readily a material gains or loses electrons. Materials with higher electron affinity gain electrons, while those with lower electron affinity lose them.

At the point of contact, the outermost electrons of each material interact, causing electrons to transfer from one material to the other. This electron flow results in an electrical potential difference, creating voltage between the materials. When the materials are separated, the transferred electrons remain on the surface of one material, while the other becomes positively charged due to electron loss. This charge separation generates electrical energy, which can be harnessed for various applications.

TENGs leverage this effect to convert mechanical energy from sources like motion, vibration, or pressure into electricity, holding promise for sustainable energy harvesting and self-powered sensor devices.

Literature Review

Historical development of TENG technology
The triboelectric effect, which is the generation of an electric charge when two dissimilar materials are brought into contact and then separated, has been known for centuries. However, it was not until 2012 that the first triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) was developed by a team of researchers led by Zhong Lin Wang at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
Wang's group's TENG was a simple device consisting of two layers of aluminum foil separated by a layer of Kapton polyimide film. When the two layers of aluminum foil were brought into contact and then separated, a charge transfer occurred, generating a voltage and current.
Since then, there has been a rapid explosion of research on TENG technology. Researchers have developed new and improved TENG materials, designs, and fabrication methods. TENGs have also been integrated into a wide range of applications, including energy harvesting, sensing, and biomedical devices.

Sensor Design
TENG Sensor

Figure 02: TENG sensor: As Sensing device
Working Principle

Figure 03: Schematic of sensor

Contact & Separation: The TENG sensor mainly consist of two different material. One with high electron affinity (electron-attracting) and one with lower electron affinity. When an external force is applied, these two materials come into contact and separate resulting in the triboelectric effect. 

Triboelectric Effect: During the contact and separation process, electrons are transferred from one material to the other due to the difference in their electron affinities. This transfer of electrons leads to a temporary charge imbalance on the surfaces of the materials.

Charge Separation: As a result of the triboelectric effect, one of the materials becomes positively charged (electron-deficient), while the other becomes negatively charged (electron-rich). These charges are localized on the surfaces of the materials.

Electrostatic Induction: The electric charges on the surfaces of the materials induce an electric field between them. This electric field is what you can sense and measure.

Sensing Operation: When the external force or stimulus changes, it can alter the degree of contact and separation between the materials. As this happens, the amount of charge separation and the resulting electric field also change. These variations in the electric field can be measured as changes in voltage or current, depending on how the TENG is configured.

Signal Detection: By connecting electrodes to the TENG’s surfaces and appropriate measurement circuitry, changes in the electric field can be detected and quantified. These changes correspond to the external stimulus being sensed.

			Procedure:
Preparing the Triboelectric Materials and spacers:
Take one A4 size bristol board and one Laminating paper (A4 size) as the two triboelectric materials. (per 1 sensor)
Cut 6 spacers measuring 21 cm x 2.5 cm using a tribo-neutral material.
Assembling the Sensor:
Use adhesive tape to attach the 6 spacers between the two triboelectric materials.
Fix each spacer with a 2.5 cm gap.
Creating the Conductive Surfaces:
Cut two aluminum foils, each measuring 25cm x 15cm.
Apply a layer of conductive adhesive or tape to one side of each of the two triboelectric materials.
Place the aluminum foil on top of the adhesive-coated side of each material, ensuring good contact and uniform coverage.
Smooth out any wrinkles or air bubbles to ensure a secure connection.
Securing the Sensor:
Use adhesive tape to secure the edges of the laminating paper and bristol board together, encapsulating the spacers and ensuring the two triboelectric materials are held firmly in place.

TENG Energy Harvestor

Working Principle
Figure 05: Schematic of sensor


Configuration:
Bottom Aluminum Layer (Conductive Layer): This layer is the first point of contact when a water droplet approaches the TENG.

PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene) Layer (Triboelectric Material): Positioned above the bottom aluminum layer, the PTFE layer is the material where the triboelectric effect occurs when it comes into contact with the water droplet.
Top Aluminum Stripe (Conductive Layer): Fixed on top of the PTFE layer, this aluminum stripe acts as a second conductive layer.

Contact and Separation with Water Droplets: The TENG is strategically designed with three layers: a bottom aluminum conductive layer, a middle PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene) layer (a triboelectric material), and a top aluminum stripe. When water droplets flow over the TENG, they sequentially come into contact with these layers.

Triboelectric Effect with Water Droplets: Due to the triboelectric effect, the PTFE layer acquires a positive charge (electron-deficient), while the water droplets carry a negative charge (electron-rich). These charges accumulate on the respective surfaces of the PTFE layer and the water droplets.

Charge Separation with Water Droplets: Due to the triboelectric effect, the PTFE layer acquires a positive charge (electron-deficient), while the water droplets carry a negative charge (electron-rich). These charges accumulate on the respective surfaces of the PTFE layer and the water droplets.

Induced Electric Field during Contact: The accumulation of charges on the PTFE layer and the water droplets induces an electric field between them. This electric field occurs across the PTFE layer, which acts as a dielectric material.

Sensing Operation: As water droplets continue to flow and interact with the TENG, their repeated contact and separation events modulate the charge separation and the electric field across the PTFE layer. The magnitude and distribution of these charges change in response to the presence and movement of water droplets.

Voltage Generation during Sensing: The dynamic changes in the electric field induce voltage across the PTFE layer and between the two aluminum layers. These variations in voltage correspond directly to the motion and presence of the water droplets.

Sensing Output: By connecting electrodes to the aluminum layers, you can capture the voltage generated during the sensing operation. This voltage output can be measured and analyzed to sense and quantify the flow rate, frequency, or other characteristics of the water droplets passing through the TENG.
